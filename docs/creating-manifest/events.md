# Events

Any <a href="/creating-manifest/actions/" target="_blank">action</a>, available to be performed by means of <a href="https://docs.jelastic.com/api/" target="_blank">API</a> (including <a href="/creating-manifest/custom-scripts/" target="_blank">custom scripts</a> running), should be bound to some event and executed as a result of this event occurrence.
Each event triggers a particular action on the required application's lifecycle stage. The entry point for executing any action is the [*onInstall*](#oninstall) event.                                  

## Events Execution Rules    

- Such events as *onBeforeDelete* and *onAfterDelete* (which refer to an environment deletion) can be executed just once. Other events can be used as much times as required.                              

- The scaling events (*onBeforeScaleOut/onAfterScaleOut*, *onBeforeScaleIn/onAfterScaleIn*, *onBeforeServiceScaleOut/onAfterServiceScaleOut*, *onBeforeSetCloudletCount/onAfterSetCloudletCount*) are called once upon any node count change. Herewith, count of the *addNode* or *removeNode* actionsâ€™ execution refer to the number of nodes that should be added/removed per a single scaling event.                                         

- For application server, load balancer and VPS node layers, the *onBeforeCloneNodes/onAfterCloneNodes* events are executed each time the node group is scaled out.                             

- The *onBeforeLinkNodes/onAfterLinkNodes*, *onBeforeUnlinkNodes/onAfterUnlinkNodes*, *onBeforeSetEnvVars/onAfterSetEnvVars*, *onBeforeSetEntryPoint/onAfterSetEntryPoint*, *onBeforeSetRunCmd/onAfterSetRunCmd*, *onBeforeAddVolume/onAfterAddVolume* and *onBeforeRemoveVolume/onAfterRemoveVolume* events can be executed only once per a single *changeTopology* action.                 

- The *onBeforeStartService/onAfterStartService* event can be called only once while performing the *changeTopology* and *createEnvironment* actions.                                      

## Events Filtering

Events can be filtered by <a href="/creating-manifest/selecting-containers/#all-containers-by-group" target="_blabk">*nodeGroup*</a>, <a href="/creating-manifest/selecting-containers/#all-containers-by-type" target="_blank">*nodeType*</a>, and <a href="/creating-manifest/selecting-containers/#particular-container" target="_blank">*nodeId*</a> parameters. As a result, the action is executed only when the called event matches specified filtering rules. Otherwise, if no filtering rules are specified, every event is listened by all environment entities.         

The following example describes the events filtering by *nodeGroup* (for the <b>*onAfterScaleOut*</b> event), *nodeType* (for the <b>*onAfterRestartNode*</b> event), and *nodeId* (for the <b>*onAfterResetNodePassword*</b> event). Here, filtering by the compute node group (*[cp]*) is set so that the action is executed after compute nodes are scaled out. The *nodeType* filtering is set so that the action is executed after **Apache 2** nodes are restarted. The *nodeID* filtering is set so that the action is executed after a password from the first compute node in the layer is reset.

## Events Execution Sequence

Below you can find the graphs that list actions with adjoining events. Every action has a pair of adjoining events - one of them is executed *before* the action and another one is launched *after* the action, that is when the action is finished.  

!!! note
    The <b>*createEnvironment*</b> action does not have any adjoining events, because events are bound after the environment creation.      
 
The <b>*changeTopology*</b> actions are considered quite time-consuming while being performed via the Jelastic dashboard, therefore, you can automate their workflow with the following CS actions and related events.

Another demanded actions are related to scaling procedures. The following graph provides a sequence of scaling actions and related events.

## Event List

### onInstall

The <b>*onInstall*</b> event is the entry point for executing any action. If the installation type is *install*, the <b>*onInstall*</b> event is triggered right after the environment creation. If the installation type is *update*, <b>*onInstall*</b> is the first event that is performed during the manifest installation.                          
 
### onUninstall

The <b>*onUninstall*</b> event can be called from the **Add-ons** tab at the Jelastic dashboard. This event is aimed at removing data accumulated through actions that are triggered by the <b>*onInstall*</b> event.

These monitoring triggers are based on the usage of the following resource types:            

- **CLOUDLETS** (CPU, Memory) - available only for the *NOTIFY* action type

- **NET_EXT** - external output and input traffic that are available only for the *NOTIFY* action type                                      

- **NET_EXT_OUT** - external output traffic                         

- **DISK** - disk space amount that is available only for the *NOTIFY* action type                                     

- **INODES** - available only for the *NOTIFY* action type                                                                    

- **Disk I/O** - disk input/output rate                                                                                                   

- **Disk IOPS** - disk input/output rate (in operations per second)                                                            

The units of measurement are *PERCENTAGE* and *SPECIFIC*. The second value is available only for **NET_EXT** and **NET_EXT_OUT** resource types.

The following example illustrates the subscription to the *onAlert* event. Here, the *log* action is executed if one of the triggers within the compute (*[cp]*) layer is invoked.

This example involves execution of the Jelastic API *addTrigger* method with a set of required parameters:     

- `name` - name of a notification trigger
- `nodeGroup` - target node group (you can apply trigger to any node group within the chosen environment)
- `period` - load period for nodes
- `condition` - rules for monitoring resources
    - `type` - comparison sign, the available values are *GREATER* and *LESS*
    - `value` - percentage of a resource that is monitored                               
    - `resourceType` - types of resources that are monitored by a trigger, namely *CPU, Memory (RAM), Network, Disk I/O*, and *Disk IOPS*
    - `valueType` - measurement value. Here, *PERCENTAGES*  is the only possible measurement value. The available range is from <b>*0*</b> up to <b>*100*</b>.
- `actions` - object to describe a trigger action
    - `type` - trigger action, the available values are *NOTIFY*, *ADD_NODE*, and *REMOVE_NODE*
    - `customData`:
        - `notify`- alert notification sent to a user via email 

The Jelastic engine sends an alert notification to the Cloud Scripting system when the appropriate trigger is invoked. Therefore, the *onAlert* event provides a possibility to bind actions to alert notifications and execute custom actions.
